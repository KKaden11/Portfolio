## Strings

### Introduction

**What are strings?**  
Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text in programming. They can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

```javascript
// Add two strings together
let fruit1 = "Apple";
let fruit2 = "Banana";
let combinedFruits = fruit1 + " and " + fruit2;
console.log("Fruits to eat: " + combinedFruits);
```

In JavaScript, strings can be wrapped in single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

### String Length and Indexing

**String length** tells you how many characters are in a string (including spaces).

```javascript
let message = "Hello World";
console.log(message.length); // 11
```

**String indexing** lets you access individual characters. Indexes start at `0`.

```javascript
let greeting = "Hello World";
console.log(greeting[0]); // H
console.log(greeting[6]); // W
```

### String Concatenation

String concatenation means combining two or more strings, usually with `+`.

```javascript
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Smith";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName); // John Smith
```

### Practice Challenges

1. Fix this code so the sentence prints correctly:

```javascript
let sport1 = "Soccer";
let sport2 = "Basketball";
console.log(The sports I play are:  + sport1 + " and " + sport2);
```

2. Update this password check so it requires at least 8 characters and starts with `"3"`:

```javascript
let password = "abc";
if (password.length < 8 || password[0] !== "3") {
  console.log("Password must be at least 8 characters and start with '3'");
} else {
  console.log("Password is valid!");
}
```

3. Use concatenation to print a sentence about yourself:

```javascript
const name = "Kaden";
const age = 14;
const city = "San Diego";

// Concatenating the variables into a single sentence
console.log("My name is " + name + ", I am " + age + " years old, and I live in " + city + ".");
```
