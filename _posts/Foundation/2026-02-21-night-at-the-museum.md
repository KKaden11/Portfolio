## Night at the museum

This is a new blog post titled Night at the Museum.

### Notes Taken At Night at the Museum

- Brainstorm ideas with your team using whiteboards, then organize tasks on a Kanban board.
- Use an LLM to help turn ideas into code and choose common web tools like HTML for frontend and JavaScript for backend.
- Write part of the code yourself so you understand the syntax and can prove your coding skills.
- If you are in CSP or CSA, create a SQL database to store input data and connect it to your project.
- Review your UI code and remove extra or unnecessary elements to keep the design clean.
- Have playtesters or users try your app, collect feedback, and improve the project into a polished final version.

### Clicker Game

- Built the layout with HTML and styled it in CSS.
- Used JavaScript to count clicks and update the score live.
- Added upgrades so each click can earn more points.
- Tested the game and adjusted values to keep it balanced and fun.
